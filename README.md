See the overall picture of **implementations on microservices with .net tools** on real-world **e-commerce microservices** project;

![microservices_remastered](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1147445/110304529-c5b70180-800c-11eb-832b-a2751b5bda76.png)

There is a couple of microservices which implemented **e-commerce** modules over **Product, Basket, Discount** and **Ordering** microservices with **NoSQL (MongoDB, Redis)** and **Relational databases (PostgreSQL, Sql Server)** with communicating over **RabbitMQ Event Driven Communication** and using **Ocelot API Gateway**.

* Override Environment variables

## Run The Project
You will need the following tools:

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [.Net Core 5 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/5)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up: (Before Run Start the Docker Desktop)
1. Clone the repository
2. Once Docker for Windows is installed, go to the **Settings > Advanced option**, from the Docker icon in the system tray, to configure the minimum amount of memory and CPU like so:
* **Memory: 4 GB**
* CPU: 2
3. At the root directory which include **docker-compose.yml** files, run below command:
```csharp
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up –d
```
3. Wait for docker compose all microservices. That’s it! (some microservices need extra time to work so please wait if not worked in first shut)

4. You can **launch microservices** as below urls:

* **Catalog API -> http://host.docker.internal:8000/swagger/index.html**
* **Basket API -> http://host.docker.internal:8001/swagger/index.html**
* **Discount API -> http://host.docker.internal:8002/swagger/index.html**
* **Ordering API -> http://host.docker.internal:8004/swagger/index.html**
* **Shopping.Aggregator -> http://host.docker.internal:8005/swagger/index.html**
* **API Gateway -> http://host.docker.internal:8010/Catalog**
* **Rabbit Management Dashboard -> http://host.docker.internal:15672**   -- guest/guest
* **Portainer -> http://host.docker.internal:9000**   -- admin/admin1234
* **pgAdmin PostgreSQL -> http://host.docker.internal:5050**   -- admin@aspnetrun.com/admin1234
* **Elasticsearch -> http://host.docker.internal:9200**
* **Kibana -> http://host.docker.internal:5601**

* **Web Status -> http://host.docker.internal:8007**
* **Web UI -> http://host.docker.internal:8006**

5. Launch http://host.docker.internal:8007 in your browser to view the Web Status. Make sure that every microservices are healthy.
6. Launch http://host.docker.internal:8006 in your browser to view the Web UI. You can use Web project in order to **call microservices over API Gateway**. When you **checkout the basket** you can follow **queue record on RabbitMQ dashboard**.

>Note: If you are running this application in macOS then use `docker.for.mac.localhost` as DNS name in `.env` file and the above URLs instead of `host.docker.internal`.

## The Book - Microservices Architecture and Step by Step Implementation on .NET

You can find **Microservices Architecture and Step by Step Implementation on .NET book** which **step by step developing** this repository with extensive explanations and details. This book is the **best path to leverage your .NET skills** in every aspect from beginner to senior level you can benefit to ramp-up faster on **Enterprise Application Development practices** and easy to **Onboarding to Full Stack .Net Core Developer jobs**. 

The book also includes more practical information and I **update it regularly** and send it again with new versions.
So the idea is once you buy a book, I take this as **supporting me** and **join them in my privilege group** for sharing **next outputs**.
For example I am planning to add **IdentityServer4 implementation**, firstly I added it into a book and sent it to you.
