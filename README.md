## The Book - Microservices Architecture and Step by Step Implementation on .NET

You can find **Microservices Architecture and Step by Step Implementation on .NET book** which **step by step developing** this repository with extensive explanations and details. This book is the **best path to leverage your .NET skills** in every aspect from begginer to senior level you can benefit to ramp-up faster on **Enterprise Application Development practices** and easy to **Onboarding to Full Stack .Net Core Developer jobs**.

## Run The Project
You will need the following tools:

* [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)
* [.Net Core 3.1 or later](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1)
* [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

### Installing
Follow these steps to get your development environment set up:
1. Clone the repository
2. At the root directory which include **docker-compose.yml** files, run below command:
```csharp
docker-compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.override.yml up –build
```
3. Wait for docker compose all microservices. That’s it!

4. You can **launch microservices** as below urls:
* **RabbitMQ -> http://localhost:15672/**
* **Catalog API -> http://localhost:8000/swagger/index.html**
* **Basket API -> http://localhost:8001/swagger/index.html**
* **Order API -> http://localhost:8002/swagger/index.html**
* **API Gateway -> http://localhost:7000/Order?username=swn**
* **Web UI -> http://localhost:8003/**

5. Launch http://localhost:8003/ in your browser to view the Web UI. You can use Web project in order to **call microservices over API Gateway**. When you **checkout the basket** you can follow **queue record on RabbitMQ dashboard**.
